# Puzzle
When you build a website, you almost always use the same components over and over again. Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to implement these components for every new website anew but could just drag and drop them together in a matter of minutes?
This was the initial thought I had while theorizing about this project.
Puzzle tries to combine IDE and CMS in a way that both, web developers and people who don't know anything about programming, will have no issues putting together their websites with ease.

### Goals:
- An intuitive and easy to use user interface
- Support for multiple Websites (so you can theoretically host a "Build your own Website" service or host websites of your clients)
- User defined page tree
- WYSIWYG page editor with drag & drop support
- Custom widget editor to create own controls for the page editor
- Widget catalog with community support (not monetizable)
- Basic preset widgets (Navbar, Footer, Socials etc...)
- Plugin support
